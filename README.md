## 🚀 Project Vision

The EFC (Emotion-Focused Computing) Framework is an open-source, modular architecture for emotionally intelligent and ethically aligned AI.
It combines sentiment analysis, context balancing, needs evaluation and failsafe mechanisms to create transparent, controllable, and responsible AI systems.
This project is not “just code”, but a blueprint for human-centered, trustworthy AI development.
