*Louis Janssens & GitHub Copilot – 19/05/2025*

## Preparation for Running Tests

1. **Make sure that only one test file is in 'EFC_Test_map' at a time.**
   - Delete or move other test files from this folder before running a new test.

2. **Check that all necessary modules are in the same folder as the test file, or can be imported correctly.**

3. **Run the test with:**
   
   '''bash
   python EFC_Test_map\<AA_test_Overhaull>.py
   
   ```
5. **When finished, you can delete the test file or replace it with another test file from 'Z_testing_files'.**
